# Operating System Mini Project

## 📋 Project Overview
This mini project is a practical implementation based on concepts of Operating Systems such as process scheduling, memory management, and system calls.  
It aims to simulate real-world OS functionalities and provide hands-on experience with system-level programming.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Language:** C / C++ (modify based on your project)
- **Platform:** Linux / Windows (modify if needed)
- **Tools:** GCC Compiler, Visual Studio Code / Code::Blocks / Terminal

## 📚 Topics Covered
- Process Scheduling (e.g., FCFS, SJF, Round Robin)
- Memory Management (e.g., Paging, Segmentation)
- Deadlock Avoidance Techniques
- File System Management
- Synchronization (e.g., Semaphores, Mutex)

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
3. Compile the project:
   ```bash
   gcc main.c -o os_project
   ```
4. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./os_project
   ```
